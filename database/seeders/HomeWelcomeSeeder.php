We work with underprivileged children in all their forms: working children, out-of-school children, begging children, children in difficult situations, etc. Our approach covers their needs from education, health and livelihood to rescuing and repatriation. SOPAN is manned by a team of experienced social workers and dedicated para-professionals. They serve as the backbone of all the projects being implemented by it in partnership with other organizations. Some of its team members once had been workingâ€™ children as well as the students of Sopan. They are truly the life-blood of the organization, keep it invigorated and growing.',
